Backtracking and recursion

1. There are 3 buckets of unlimited 5, 10 and 25 cents. If we can pick 5 coins, print all the combinations of  of the coins that can be made.

2. I have following coins 1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,10,10,10,10, 25,25 Can I make a total of 73 cents. if yes how many combinations can I make print them out. Hint This is baqsically generate all sub sets (Binary sequence)
